### Negotiation is like playing cards.

- know what you can ask for
  - base salary, equity, health coverage, hardware, annual bonus, 401k, relocation bonus, lunch, gym membership, WFH, signing bonus, training budget, title, network strength, manager, the work, industry, growth potential
  - Monetary...
  - Future potential
  - Happiness
  - other
- Big asks, small asks, limited flexibility

- know what you need:
  - what is the lowest salary you will take?
  - how important is salary vs. equity?
  - is health coverage mandatory?
- ask about equity and health coverage
- understand everything about the offer so you can benchmark it against what you want
- Execute a Negotiation

### Research

### Avoid naming the first number
- Highest priority is finding the right opportunity
- What is the salary range you typically see for this position
- Give a salary range mid to high 60's, but open to any compensation package that is competitive
- Definitely open to any compensation package that is fair and competitive
- I'm happy to discuss that at the right point in the process

### Timeline
- Receiving the Offer (ask open ended question)
- Actively Researching the Offer (glassdoor, re-meet with hiring manager, speak with the recruiter more)
  - Research Goals: Establish market rate, clarity role and show readiness, understand total equity
- Winning Allies
- Asking for big things
- Asking for little things
- Accepting the Offer

- **Questions?** Shares (outstanding, fully diluted), Code Reviews, Documentation, Onboarding process, path to promotion, management style, competitors, size of industry, plan for growth
- **Bad Questions...** can I leave at 5, how often can I work from home? when would I be promoted? how much vacation can I take
