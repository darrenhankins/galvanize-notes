- Last In, First Out (LiFo)
  - push - adds to top of stack - O(1)
  - pop - removes from top of stack - O(1)
  - Peek - shows the top value of the stack - O(1)
  - O(1) - Big O is constant


- Problems Solved
  - Undo/Redo
  - Maze Solving (back tracking)
  - Math with reverse polish notation (used in many calculators)
  - Function call stack (javascript runtime)

- First In, First Out (FiFo)
- Members (enqueue, dequeue) Big O is constant = O(1)
  - enqueue - add an element to the end of the collection O(1)
