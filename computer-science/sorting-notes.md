##### Bubble Sort
  - Keep swapping until you're at the end of the array. Then move onto the next element in the array and repeat.
  - Not an efficient algorithm
  - O(n^2) Quadratic

##### Selection Sort
  - comparing each array item to its neighbor, locate the smallest remaining value and drop it into the correct place in the array
  - O(n^2) Quadratic

##### Insertion Sort
  - An insertion sort works by separating an array into two sections:
    - a sorted section an unsorted section.
    - Initially, the entire array is unsorted
  - O(n^2) Quadratic
