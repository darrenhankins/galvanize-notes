To whom it may concern,

Hi, my name is Darren Hankins. I am a Full Stack Web Developer who has spent the last couple years expanding my knowledge and brand, as I set out to improve and revamp my skill set. Along the way, I've met some great individuals, learned some new cutting edge skills, and strived to create the best version of myself to date.

As recent graduate of Galvanize's Full Stack Immersive Program, I've focused the last 6 months, 5 days a week, 7 hours a day, and countless hours after class, utilizing industry best practices, project management tools and cutting edge technologies.

Your job posting lists many of the skills that I possess and have been honing the last couple years. Skills that include UX/UI, HTML, CSS, Node, PHP, Bootstrap, and Photoshop to name a few. My freelance work on client projects and websites have given me real work experience maintaining and supporting my own virtual Ubuntu Server.

My desire is to work with a great team like yours and continue to learn and improve my skill set. I feel like I will be able to bring a great deal of depth and knowledge to this position while maintaining and pursuing the standards already set forth by your brand.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to talking with you.

Sincerely,


Darren Hankins
