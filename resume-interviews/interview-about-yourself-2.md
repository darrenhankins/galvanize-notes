##### Tell me about a project you have worked on.

Look for these things in their answer:
- How do you solve problems?
- Speak plainly about tech.
- How do you respond to pressure?
- How do you handle conflict?
- Story, what you learned

One of our group projects we had the luxury of selecting
a technology we were unfamiliar with. As we encounter
obstacles/blockers, we responding by working in pairs to resolve
or figure out blockers.

With conflict my hope to clearly identify the problem to
that everyone has a understanding

  - Situation
  - Task
  - Action
  - Resolution

Corn Maze
Situation: 3 years ago I started a corn maze on the family farm. Because of delays in the application process through the county, I was cut short on time.

Task: Because of this hold up, I was faced with possibly not being able to open the day that I had been advertising

Action: I timeboxed each of the items to complete my MVP and removed any STRETCH items I had hoped to integrate.

Resolution: I was able to open on time and had a successful opening season. This year we will be in our 4 season.

##### How to handle conflict?

Look for these things in their answer:
  - tell a story
  - could be Galvanize/tech related or previous experience
  - find a way to talk about if without being negative

##### Where do you see yourself in 3 years?
  - just have an answer!?
