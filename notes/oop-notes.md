#### 4 Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

##### Encapsulation
  - Mechanism of binding common data and the code (ex. a Class)
  - Prevent outside world from modifying things directly
  - More Maintainable

##### Inheritance
  - process by which one object inherits that of another
  - prevent duplicating code across classes (more maintainable)

##### Polymorphism
  - multiple actions with one interface
  - is-A test (deer, is a animal, is a vegetarian)

##### Abstraction (black boxing)
  - hiding unnecessary details from the user to avoid complexity and distraction
  - black box (implementation is "opaque") - terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of its internal workings
