Dear Friends and Family,

This week I have started the Galvanize Immersive Web Development program. I want all of you to know and understand the commitment that this will require over the next 6 months. Please understand if I am not as readily available as I have been in the past. I will be submersed in learning and working to putting together a solid portfolio that in the end with provide a springboard to finding a great company to work for and the knowledge to build great products.

I appreciate all of your understanding, help and support over this time.

Thank you,
Darren Hankins


Darren,

I'm writing this letter to you in order to provide inspiration, focus and determination with regards to the journey you are about to embark on. Over the next six months, you will need to limit your exposure to aspects of your life that in the past have been self consuming. Over the next six months THIS IS IT. This is the next part in your story and its ALL OUT, balls to the wall from here till the end of March! From getting adequate rest, to limiting my commitment to other things and remaining focused and determined. Remember what is at stake here and there is no turning back. Every day, every hour, every minute... this is what it's about.

Along with the schooling, the commitment to networking, openness and team working. In order to get to that point of confidence and finding a great job. The interview STARTS NOW and is now a way of life. Live it, Love it, DO IT!

Good Luck!
