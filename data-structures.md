###  Introduction to Data Structures (slides)

- Most fundamental concept of Computer Science
- Building blocks for the computing world
- Knowledge of data structures ...


Store, organize and Group data
  - Effiency

Data Structure
  - way to store and organize data in a computer so it can be used efficiently
  - efficiency of the data structure

#### Memory Management

In lower level languages like C C++ you must manually allocate and deallocate memory as you use it

JavaScript and Java both use automatic memory management called "Garbage Collection"

#### Data Structures

2 ways to talk about data Structures
  - mathematical and logical models
    - Abstract Data Type (ADT)
      - describes what is does, not how it does it
      - support ADT (C++, C#, Java, Python etc.)
  - implementation

  List ADT (an array in js)
    - store given number by type
    - read elements by position
    - modify element at a position

  Model a Reservation System
    - What data to store?
      - seats
    - What operations do you provide?
      - sets available
      - reserve a seat
      - cancel a Reservation
      - find a block of available seats

- Arrays
- Linked list
- Stacks
- Queues
- Graphs
