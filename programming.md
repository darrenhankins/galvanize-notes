### Programming

#### Programming Languages Do These 3 Things
  - **Sequence** (control the order)
    - control over that *order*


  - **Selection** (code can have multiple paths ex. if then)
    - code can have *branching* logic


  - **Iteration** (for, while, do while, recursion)
    - working with *collection*  (list of data)


  (Core of most programs is working through a list)


#### Pseudocode

  - Tool made up to help you through


##### Structured English

  - Every statement should be unambiguous


  1. Operation statements written as English phrases executed from the top down
  - Conditional blocks indicated by keywords such as IF, THEN, and ELSE
  - Repetition blocks indicated by keywords such as DO, WHILE, and UNTIL
