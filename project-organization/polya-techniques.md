##### 1. Polya’s First Principle: Understand the problem

  - Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
  - What are you asked to find or show?
  - Can you restate the problem in your own words?
  - Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the problem?
  - Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?

##### 2. Polya’s Second Principle: Devise a plan


  - define the project...
    - explain what is it?
      - create code that iterates through an array of numbers and determines if the number should be assigned "Fizz" or "Buzz"
    - explain what does it do?
  - define parameters (what are the requirements)
    -
  - wireframe (how is it put together)
  - pseudocode (what will the code do)
    - iterate through array and determine if a number is "Fizz" or "Buzz"


  "What if I can't do it that way. Think of restriction. What other way can it be done"

  "Attack from many different angles."
